## Installation
If you'd like to install the dashboard on your local machine for modification or testing, you can find the GitHub repository at https://github.com/Tomjp424/weather-dashboard. Clone the repository to your local machine, and then navigate to the root of the repository within your terminal and run `npm install` to ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed.

## Usage
Usage of the app is very simple and straightforward. Enter the name of a city into the search box and then click `Search`. You will be presented with the weather for that city for the next five days. The city you searched for will also be added to the list of previously searched cities. You can use these as shortcuts to search for the forecast of any particular city again, or you can delete an entry by clicking the red delete button next to the entry.

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to the app, you can fork the repository and make any changes or additions you'd like.

## Testing
Testing for the app could involve feeding the search bar various misspellings of city names to see if it can parse the correct city, or by entering fake cities to see how it handles having no weather data to serve.
